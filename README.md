# Nashville City Cemetery

The city of Nashville provides a dataset of known burials in city cemeteries from 1846 through 1979. This dataset holds factual information, but it also offers a fascinating glimpse into historical trends in medicine, literacy, racial equality, and more.

 As part of the excel course,The Nashville City Cemetery Association has approached our school asking to analyze some of their data. This analysis will be used to compare the attributes of The Nashville City Cemetery with other historic cemeteries throughout the country. Note that much of this data comes from handwritten record books, so there are inconsistencies, typographical errors, etc. They realize their data is messy and there will be times during the analysis in which we will need to decide how data cleaning will be handled. The association realizes that completely cleaning the data would be too time intensive and they are willing to sacrifice some accuracy for speed.

The questions that follow provide us with some guidance for the initial analysis of the data. As I am working, I created a new sheet in my Excel file for each pivot table or analysis work done to create a visualization.


1. Use a pivot table to find the 10 most common (known) recorded causes of death, and evaluate the counts of each type. 

2. Create a line chart showing the number of burials per year. How would you describe the overall trend in number of burials per year? In what years were there the most burials? Can you think of any plausible reason why?

3. Create a pivot table that shows the number of burials per year per month.   
a. Apply conditional formatting to change the background color based on the number of burials. You can read about using conditional formatting here: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-conditional-formatting-to-highlight-information-fed60dfa-1d3f-4e13-9ecb-f1951ff89d7f  
b. Drill down into any months that stand out to investigate. What do you find?

4. Create a "Decade" column based off of the Burial Year column. Use a pivot table to examine burials for each decade. Look at the total number of burials and the proportion (aka percentage) of male burials and female burials. Create a clustered bar chart to show how male and female burials have changed over time. 

5. Next look at how age at the time of death has changed over time. Add a column to the original dataset to classify each row to one of the following categories (0-18, 19-25, 26-40, 41-64, and 65+). Also create the following groups: Before 1880, 1880-1900, 1901-1920, After 1920. Use a grouped bar chart to show how the proportion of burials per age group has changed over time. How would you describe the trends in terms of proportion of burials per age group over time?
